The objective of this project is to tackle the issues of mental health and the stigma 
surrounding it. 
In this project, we create a user-friendly GUI (interface with Tkinter) to help users 
with their mental health struggles. The GUI includes a questionnaire that helps users 
to localize the area of problem, give appropriate advice based on their answers, and 
remind them that they are not alone in their mental health journey.
In the GUI, we also attach articles on awareness of mental health, as well as calming 
video links (such as videos with sea sounds, study music etc.) for the user to watch, 
if they are in need of some comfort.

he interface consists of 10 buttons:
a. 4 of them lead to a new frame consisting of a questionnaire and advice 
box.
b. 3 of them lead directly to an advice box
c. 3 others lead to awareness articles and meditation links.
• The above questionnaire consists of three questions for each issue and displays 
appropriate advice by calculating the permutations and combinations of the 
answers selected by the user.
• The user has the availability of rating their experience through the feedback form.
• The exit button enables the user to close the interface
